## 📌 Description

Digital Pendulum is a custom integration for Home Assistant that vocally announces the time, just like a digital pendulum 🕰️.

Using a compatible smart speaker as a player, the system:

- 📢 announces the time every hour and/or every half hour (configurable)
- 🌍 automatically speaks in the language set in Home Assistant  
- ⏰ only works within a configurable time slot 
- 🔔 can play a custom sound before the announcement
- 🔕 can disable the voice announcement (bell only)
- 🏰 can play the Westminster chime at 12 o'clock

The result is an elegant and discreet effect, ideal for home or office.

## 🔊 Supported Devices

Digital Pendulum supports three player types:

| Type | Description | Requirement |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Alexa** | Amazon Echo devices | [alexa_media_player](https://github.com/custom-components/alexa_media_player) via HACS |
| **Google Home / Nest** | Google Home, Nest Mini, Nest Hub, Chromecast | Google Cast (native HA integration) |
| **Generic** | Any other HA media_player device | TTS engine configured in HA (functionality may vary) |
| **Script** | Anything your own script can do | A Home Assistant script (see below) |

During setup you will be asked to select the player type first, then the specific device.

### 🧩 Script player (advanced)

With the **Script** player type Digital Pendulum does not play anything itself: it starts a Home Assistant script of your choice, passing
- `chime_url` for every chime (empty string = default chime), or
- `message` and `language` for every announcement (the text already built in your language).

The script decides how and where to play them: several speakers, a specific TTS engine, a notification integration, extra conditions (e.g. do not disturb). Use `mode: queued` so that chime and announcement always play in order.

```yaml
script:
  pendulum_speaker:
    mode: queued
    sequence:
      - if: "{{ chime_url is defined and chime_url != '' }}"
        then:
          - action: media_player.play_media
            target:
              entity_id: media_player.kitchen
            data:
              media_content_id: "{{ chime_url }}"
              media_content_type: audio/mp3
              announce: true
      - if: "{{ message is defined }}"
        then:
          - action: tts.speak
            target:
              entity_id: tts.home_assistant_cloud
            data:
              media_player_entity_id: media_player.kitchen
              message: "{{ message }}"
```

## ✨ Main features

### 🕑 Automatic time announcement
- every hour (xx:00)
- every half hour (xx:30) - optional (chime only or chime + voice, configurable)

### ⏱️ Configurable delay after chime
- adjustable waiting time between chime and voice announcement (default: 1.2 seconds)
- useful especially for Google Home / Nest devices, which may need a longer delay to play the voice announcement correctly

### 🌐 Automatic multilingual support
- Italian 🇮🇹
- English 🇬🇧
- French 🇫🇷
- German 🇩🇪
- Spanish 🇪🇸
- Polish 🇵🇱
- Czech 🇨🇿
- Slovak 🇸🇰
- Portuguese 🇵🇹
  
🌐 **Customizable language:** You can choose a different language from the one set in Home Assistant (useful for example for those who have HA in English but want announcements in their native language).

### 🕐 Configurable time slot
- e.g. only from 8:00 to 22:00

###  🔔 Optional bell
- 🎵 12 preset sounds to choose from
- 🎶 option to use a custom audio file
- 🔕 default notification sound (if nothing is selected)
- ⏳ option for a dedicated half-hour sound

### 🧪 Test function
- to immediately try the announcement

### 🎯 Behaviour

**Bell (Chime):**
- **Available presets**: 12 sounds including church-bell, simple-bell, clock-chime, etc.
- **Custom sound**: Select "custom" and enter the path of your audio file
- **Default**: notification sound (if you select nothing)
- **Disabled**: Disable "use_chime" for no sound before the announcement

**Westminster Melody (Tower Clock):**
- Separate "tower_clock" option
- Plays **only at 12:00** (noon)
- Replaces the normal chime at that time

**Voice announcement:**
- **Enabled** (default): the device pronounces the time after the bell
- **Disabled**: Bell sound only, no voice announcement

**Half-hour voice announcement:**
- **Enabled** (default): voice announcement plays at both :00 and :30
- **Disabled**: chime still plays at :30, but no voice announcement

## ⚙️ How it works

Digital Pendulum synchronises with the system clock and automatically checks every minute whether it is time to make an announcement.

**When the announcement triggers:**
1. 🔔 Plays the chosen bell (if enabled)
2. ⏱️ Waits a configurable number of seconds (default: 1.2s) — increase this value for Google Home / Nest devices if the voice announcement does not play correctly
3. 🗣️ The device pronounces the time in the Home Assistant language (if enabled)

Everything happens automatically without the need to configure automations!

## 🗣️ Language handling

The language is automatically detected from Home Assistant.

🌐 **Announcement language:** Possibility to choose the language of voice announcements independently from the language set in Home Assistant (available: Italiano, English, Deutsch, Español, Français, Português, Polski, Čeština, Slovenčina, or Automatic to follow the Home Assistant language).

Announcement examples:

| Language | Time | Announcement |
|------|------|--------|
| 🇮🇹 IT | 10:30 | Ore 10 e trenta |
| 🇬🇧 EN | 14:00 | It's 2 o'clock in the afternoon |
| 🇫🇷 FR | 9:30 | Il est 9 heures trente |
| 🇩🇪 DE | 16:30 | Es ist halb 17 |
| 🇪🇸 ES | 11:00 | Son las 11 |
| 🇵🇱 PL | 15:30 | Wpół do czwartej |
| 🇨🇿 CS | 8:30 | Půl deváté |
| 🇸🇰 SK | 8:30 | Pol deviatej |
| 🇵🇹 PT | 10:30 | São 10 e meia |

## 🔔 Chime (initial bell)

If the use_chime option is active:
- the notification sound or the chosen sound is played
- the system waits a configurable number of seconds (default: 1.2)
- the voice announcement starts (if enabled)

This creates an effect similar to a real pendulum 🎶.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Alexa issues or "Cannot find EU skill" error

**alexa_media_player** problem, not Digital Pendulum.

**Quick fix:**
1. Settings → Devices and services → Alexa Media Player
2. Three dots → Reload
3. If it doesn't work: uninstall and reinstall Alexa Media Player

---

### Google Home / Nest: no voice announcement

Digital Pendulum uses the TTS engine configured in HA for Google devices.

This is a known timing issue with Google devices. The voice announcement may be cut or skipped if the delay after the chime is too short.

1. Check that a TTS engine is configured in HA (Settings → Voice assistants)
2. Check the HA log for TTS errors
3. Increase the **"Delay after chime"** value (try 2.0 or 3.0 seconds)
4. Try the "Test" button to verify
---

### Wrong language

Digital Pendulum automatically uses the Home Assistant language.

1. Check: Settings → System → General → Language
2. Supported languages: 🇮🇹 🇬🇧 🇫🇷 🇩🇪 🇪🇸 🇵🇱 🇨🇿 🇸🇰 🇵🇹
3. After changing the language, restart Home Assistant

---

### No announcements

**Check:**
- Integration enabled? (Switch ON)
- Are you within the configured time slot? (default 8:00-22:00)
- Device online?
- Correct player type selected? (Alexa, Google, Generic)
- Try the "Test" button

---

### Bell only or voice only

- **Bell only:** Enable "Voice announcement"
- **Voice only:** Enable "Use chime"

---

### Westminster doesn't play at 12

- Check that "Tower Clock" is active
- Works **only at 12:00** (noon, not midnight)

---
